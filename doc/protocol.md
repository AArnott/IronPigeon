# IronPigeon Protocol

The IronPigeon protocol describes how messages can be exchanged between two or more parties.

Messages are signed for authenticity, encrypted for confidentiality,
and transmitted indirectly so that eavesdroppers find it difficult or
impossible to establish *whether* two parties have communicated,
*what* was communicated or even the *length* of the communication.
